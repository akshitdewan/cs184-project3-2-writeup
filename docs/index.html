    Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image. Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that appear. Make sure to include all screenshots.
</b></p>
        <p>
            At a ray depth of 0, only 0 bounce illumination from the area light source is seen, as no other object in the scene 
            has illuminance. At a ray depth of 1, the walls and balls can be seen, as there is an initial reflection that will intersect
            the area light source. However, the spheres will still be black. At a ray depth of 2, the mirror sphere exhibits reflective
            behavior, as rays first intersect the sphere, then the rest of the scene, and finally the light source in order to 
            reflect other objects in the scene for a total of 3 intersections or 2 bounces. The glass sphere also exhibits reflection,
            but a minimal amount of refractions.
        </p>
        <p>
            At a ray depth of 3, the glass sphere that exhibits refraction refracts much more light. This is because the light that is 
            refracted by the sphere must intersect the sphere twice. The ray first intersects the sphere while entering the sphere,
            then intersects the sphere while exiting, then intersects the rest of the scene, and finally intersects the light source for
            a total of 4 intersections or 3 bounces. At a ray depth of 4, the light that is concentrated and refracted by the glass
            sphere is reflected back on the bottom of the sphere. This causes the bottom to appear shinier / whiter. This is because
            there is another bounce of light for light that refracts through the sphere and then reflects back onto the sphere, whereas
            at a ray depth of 3 the additional sphere intersection did not occur. Additionally, a bright spot on the blue wall occurs,
            as the number of refracted rays concentrated on that spot of the wall increases because there is another bounce
            onto the glass sphere from the wall. The reflection of the glass sphere in the mirror also appears clear rather than black.
        </p>
        <p>
            At a ray depth of 5, there is no significant visual difference. Because the rate of ray termination / decay is exponential, there is a cutoff for the visibility of rays.

            At a ray depth of 100, there is laos no significant difference from a ray depth of 5. This is likely because
            most rays have already been terminated as a result of russian roulette, so their contribution is not significant. A ray 
            depth of 100 will essentially be visuall the same as a lower ray depth, as almost every ray will have already terminated by
            this point.

        <b>
            For these subparts, we recommend using a microfacet BSDF scene to show off the cool out of focus effects you can get with depth of field!

        <p><b>
            In a few sentences, explain the differences between a pinhole camera model and a thin-lens camera model. 
        </b></p>
        <p>
            A pinhole camera model refers to a small hole that all the light from the scene passes through to reach sensor. With a small pinhole, each point in the scene closely maps to a point on the sensor because only a small number of light rays can pass through. With a large pinhole, the light rays bouncing off of the same point can end up in different places in the image leading to blur. This tradeoff is improved when using a lens, because a lens bends the input light such that light originating at the same point eventually bends back to a common focal point. If the sensor is placed at the location of this focal point, that part of the image will be in focus. Because of these mechanics, a lens will be able to focus a particular part of the object whereas a pinhole will focus (or equally blur) the entire object.

            We can see that each of the four images has a different or sometimes no distinct object in focus. The clearest ones are 4.5 and 5, where 4.5 has the closer sphere in focus and 5 has the further sphere in focus. In 5, the further focal distance means that objects that are farther from the lens will be in focus because their focal point is farther. We can see this effect as we go from 5 to 5.5 as well, where both objects get blurrier because the back of the scene corresponds to the focal point. The opposite occurs when going from 4.5 to 4, where the front of the scene becomes most in focus and the back sphere is super blurry.

            The smaller the aperture, the less light is let in to the lens. Because light rays can only enter from a small radius, they typically have a relatively similar direction too. This similar direction makes it so that the light rays don't diverge much even after going through the lens, allowing a wider focal distance where an object is in focus. This constraint allows the entire image to be in focus when using a very small aperture, and correspondingly leads to a large blur when using a large aperture because only a small segment of the image can be in focus. We can see this trend going from the aperture of 0.01 to 1--slowly, only the object at a very specific distance is in focus and everything else keeps getting blurrier.
        </p>
        <br>
        <b>How our code works</b>
        We implemented a simulation of a thin lens model with the focal plane at a distance of `focalDistance`. Each point on the image plane reflects various light rays that go through the lens and converge at some focal point. We implemented a function to take a point on the image plane and sample a ray from the lens to the focal point corresponding to the image point. It works by finding the direction from the point on the image plane to the center of the lens, and uses that direction to find the focal point. Then, we sample a random point on the lens and find the ray that runs from there to the focal point computed earlier. Taking many of these samples gives an accurate depiction of the light passing through the lens to the sensor.
